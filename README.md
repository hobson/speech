# speech

Playing around with speech-processing and speech synthesis to close the loop without a keyboard

# Dependencies

I'm trying out [cmusphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) for speech recognition and parsing. I'm considering [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) for speech synthesis. It's fully synthetic (not based on recordings of actual humans), so it has that good old-fashioned robot twang. Both are open source and have python bindings, which is a huge +1 in my book.
